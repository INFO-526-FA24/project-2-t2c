# README: Visualizing Kenyan and Global Health Trends (1990-2019)

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive and interactive visualization of Kenyan and global health statistics from 1990 to 2019. By analyzing and comparing trends in population demographics, mental health (suicide and anxiety disorders), critical disease mortality, alcohol/substance use, and gender-specific patterns, we hope to uncover actionable insights for public health, policymaking, and education.

The project combines data storytelling with technical analysis, providing accessible and meaningful insights for students, researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Goals

1.  **Analyze Key Health Metrics:**

    -   Suicide rates\
    -   Critical disease mortality (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes)\
    -   Alcohol and substance use trends\
    -   Anxiety disorder prevalence

2.  **Compare Kenyan and Global Trends:**\
    Focus on differences in trends over time and between genders.

3.  **Explore Population Demographics:**

    -   Investigate population growth and age distribution.\
    -   Examine implications for labor force potential.

4.  **Identify Socio-Economic and Cultural Drivers:**\
    Correlate observed health trends with relevant socio-economic and cultural factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Sources

-   **Kenyan Population Data (1990-2019):** Includes age distribution and growth metrics.
-   **Global and Kenyan Suicide Rates Data (2000-2019):** Gender-disaggregated suicide rates over time.
-   **Mortality Data for Critical Diseases (2000-2016):** Death probabilities from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases.
-   **Alcohol and Substance Use Data (1990-2019):** Global and Kenyan trends in alcohol and substance use prevalence.
-   **Anxiety Disorder Prevalence Data (1990-2019):** Gender-specific prevalence rates globally and in Kenya.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Questions Addressed

1.  **Suicide Trends:**
    -   How have suicide rates evolved globally and in Kenya (2000-2019)?\
    -   What are the gender-specific differences?
2.  **Mortality from Critical Diseases:**
    -   How do mortality probabilities for diseases differ between Kenya and global populations?
3.  **Alcohol and Substance Use Trends:**
    -   What are the differences in trends between Kenya and the global average?\
    -   What implications do these trends have on public health?
4.  **Anxiety Disorder Prevalence:**
    -   How does anxiety disorder prevalence differ by gender in Kenya and globally?
5.  **Population Growth and Workforce Potential:**
    -   How has population growth and age distribution impacted Kenya's labor force potential compared to global trends?
6.  **Socio-Economic and Cultural Drivers:**
    -   What socio-economic and cultural factors explain health disparities between genders and regions?

## Project Structure

### 1. **Data Preparation**

-   Cleaning and preprocessing datasets.
-   Formatting and integrating global and Kenyan-specific datasets.
-   Handling missing values and ensuring consistency across years and categories.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

-   Visualizing initial trends using histograms, line plots, and bar charts.
-   Identifying key patterns and anomalies in the data.

### 3. **Visualization**

-   **Tools:** `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Tableau` (optional).
-   Create interactive visualizations for trends, patterns, and comparisons:
    -   Time-series plots for suicide rates, substance use, and anxiety.
    -   Population pyramids and distribution charts.
    -   Scatter plots and correlation matrices for socio-economic factors.

### 4. **Analysis and Insights**

-   Gender-based analysis of trends.
-   Regional comparisons between Kenya and global averages.
-   Contextualizing findings with socio-economic and cultural insights.
