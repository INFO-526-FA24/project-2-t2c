## Project Proposal: Visualizing Brexit and Its Impacts

## High-Level Goal

Create a comprehensive and visually engaging analysis of Brexit-related data to better understand the referendum's impact on the UK's population, regional voting patterns, well-being, and current issues.

## Goals and Motivation

The main objective of this project is to visualize the impact of Brexit, focusing on critical aspects such as voting patterns, population density, well-being, and public issues. The visualizations aim to clarify how different regions and age groups responded during the EU referendum, how the Brexit decision affected anxiety and well-being, and what issues dominate the discourse today.

The motivation behind this project is to provide clear and insightful data visualizations that inform the general public, policymakers, and researchers about the various effects of Brexit on the UK's social and political landscape. The project is designed to offer both an informative overview and a storytelling element to deliver an impactful message about Brexit's consequences.

## Data Sources and Description

The project will use the following datasets, focusing on regional and temporal insights:

1. **Population Density Data**: Provides population density by region within the United Kingdom.
2. **Voter Turnout Data by Region**: Contains voter turnout percentages across regions during the Brexit referendum, categorized by support for Leave or Remain.
3. **Region Vote Data**: Details the flow of votes (Leave or Remain) for each region, enabling analysis of voting proportions.
4. **Anxiety Levels Data (2012-2018)**: Tracks anxiety levels in different parts of the UK (Wales, Scotland, England, Northern Ireland) to evaluate changes in well-being after the referendum.
5. **Well-Being Data**: Contains metrics such as life satisfaction, happiness, and anxiety, assessed across different regions, for analyzing the impact of Brexit on well-being.
6. **Age Support Data**: Shows voting patterns based on age groups, highlighting which age groups had the highest support for Leave or Remain.
7. **Brexit Issues Data (Financial Times Headlines 2020)**: A dataset that captures prominent topics from Brexit-related news headlines.

These datasets will be used to create a series of interactive and static visualizations to better understand the socio-political impacts of Brexit.

## Project Questions and Visualization Plan

### 1. What is the population density of the United Kingdom?
- **Visualization**: A map of the United Kingdom using a gradient scale to represent population density, where darker shades indicate higher density.

### 2. What is the voter turnout by region?
- **Visualization**: A bar graph displaying voter turnout for each region, categorized by the proportion of votes supporting the EU referendum (Leave or Remain).

### 3. How did each region vote?
- **Plot Used**: A Sankey diagram that shows the flow of votes (Leave or Remain) from each region, with the thickness of lines representing the proportion of votes.

### 4. Has personal well-being been impacted in areas voting Remain now that the UK is leaving the EU?
- **Plot Used for Anxiety Levels**: A line graph depicting anxiety levels in the UK from 2012 to 2018, divided by different countries (Wales, Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland).
- **Plot for Measures of Well-Being**: Multiple line graphs that display metrics such as life satisfaction, feeling that life is worthwhile, happiness, and anxiety, assessed across different regions.

### 5. Was vote choice influenced by age?
- **Plot Used for Highest Support for Leave**: A bar graph that shows age groups with the highest support for Leave.
- **Plot Used for Highest Support for Remain**: Another bar graph showing which age groups had the highest support for Remain.

### 6. What are the issues around Brexit today?
- **Visualization**: A word cloud generated from Financial Times headlines (January - March 2020), highlighting prominent topics such as "trade," "talks," "immigration," and political figures like "Boris Johnson."
