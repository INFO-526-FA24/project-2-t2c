## Project Proposal: Visualizing Kenyan and Global Health Trends (1990-2019)

## High-Level Goal

Create a comprehensive and interactive visualization of Kenyan and global health statistics from 1990 to 2019, focusing on population demographics, suicide rates, critical disease mortality, alcohol/substance use, and anxiety disorders, with a comparison of global and Kenyan trends and gender differences.

## Goals and Motivation

The primary aim of this project is to visualize the evolution of critical health and demographic trends in Kenya compared to global patterns over nearly three decades. The key topics include population growth, mental health (suicide rates and anxiety disorders), substance use, and mortality from critical diseases. This project will involve both technical and storytelling elements to provide clear insights into how these factors interact and evolve.

By examining these trends, particularly the gender-specific differences in Kenya and globally, the project seeks to uncover deeper patterns related to public health, social stability, and economic development. Understanding these insights can aid in policy-making, public health strategies, and global awareness.

The motivation for selecting this topic stems from a desire to understand the underlying factors influencing public health in Kenya and how they align or differ from global trends. The visualizations will aim to provide both an educational and practical overview, targeting audiences such as students, researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in data-driven health insights.

## Data Sources and Description

The project will rely on multiple datasets, including:

1.  **Kenyan Population Data (1990-2019)**: Population growth trends, focusing on age distribution to determine the actual labor force potential.

2.  **Global and Kenyan Suicide Rates Data (2000-2019)**: Provides suicide rates categorized by gender, with a focus on changes over time.

3.  **Mortality Data for Critical Diseases (Global and Kenyan, 2000-2016)**: Tracks the probability of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, split by gender.

4.  **Alcohol and Substance Use Data (Global and Kenyan, 1990-2019)**: Covers the prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders, emphasizing key trends.

5.  **Anxiety Disorder Prevalence Data (Global and Kenyan, 1990-2019)**: Gender-specific prevalence of anxiety disorders to visualize mental health trends.

These datasets will be examined for patterns, trends, and notable shifts over the time period, particularly focusing on how Kenya's health landscape compares to global statistics.

# Project Questions

### 1. How have suicide rates evolved globally and in Kenya from 2000 to 2019, and what are the gender-specific differences in these trends?

-   **Objective**: To compare global and Kenyan suicide rates over the past two decades and analyze the gender-based differences in these trends.
-   **Method**: Use time series data to visualize the changes in suicide rates for males and females in both Kenya and globally.

### 2. What are the differences in mortality probabilities from critical diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) between global populations and the Kenyan population between 2000 and 2016?

-   **Objective**: To examine mortality rates due to critical diseases and compare the global figures with Kenyan statistics.
-   **Method**: Create line graphs or bar charts to represent mortality probabilities and observe trends for both regions.

### 3. How do trends in alcohol and substance use disorders differ globally compared to Kenya from 1990 to 2019, and what are the implications of these trends on public health in Kenya?

-   **Objective**: To identify trends in alcohol and substance use, comparing the rates in Kenya and globally and understanding the potential public health implications in Kenya.
-   **Method**: Use line plots and histograms to compare substance use trends and analyze their implications.

### 4. What is the prevalence of anxiety disorders globally and in Kenya from 1990 to 2019, and how do gender-specific trends inform our understanding of mental health challenges in these regions?

-   **Objective**: To analyze the prevalence of anxiety disorders by gender and explore how these trends differ between Kenya and the global average.
-   **Method**: Visualize the data using bar plots, box plots, and line charts, focusing on gender-based differences.

### 5. What impact has population growth and age distribution had on the labor potential in Kenya from 1990 to 2019, and how does this compare to global trends in workforce development?

-   **Objective**: To investigate the relationship between population growth, age distribution, and labor force potential in Kenya, comparing it with global trends.
-   **Method**: Use population pyramids and age distribution histograms to analyze the trends and implications for workforce development.

### 6. What socio-economic and cultural factors might explain the observed differences in health trends (suicide rates, critical disease mortality, anxiety, and substance use) between genders in Kenya compared to global averages over the last three decades?

-   **Objective**: To explore socio-economic and cultural factors that may contribute to gender-specific health disparities in Kenya and globally.
-   **Method**: Correlation analysis and scatter plots to identify socio-economic factors influencing the trends.
